# Explanation
The goal for this exercise was to get
the functions to work. The `union` function
runs in O(n+m) time, where n is the size
of the first linked list and m is the size
of the second linked list, and takes O(n+m)
space. The `intersection` function also
runs in O(n+m) time and O(n+m) space.
